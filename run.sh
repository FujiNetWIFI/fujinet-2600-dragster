#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run.sh -- run a Dragster client ROM in a FujiNet-patched MAME.
#
#   ./run.sh [rom] [lua-script]
#
# With a script it runs headless and exits; without one it opens a window.
# `rom` is a basename in build/ and defaults to dragster.
#
# The MAME tree must have had fn-2600/pico/atari-2600/emu/apply.sh run against
# it, and for anything that touches the network a fujinet-pc must be listening.
#
# Four environment facts this wraps, each of which costs time to rediscover:
#   - MAME must run FROM ITS OWN TREE or -autoboot_script is silently ignored.
#   - SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy is required wherever there is no DISPLAY, because
#     SDL comes up before the video backend is chosen.
#   - fujinet-pc's BoIP listener takes ONE client, so a MAME left running
#     starves the next run and the symptom is a hang, not an error.
#   - THROTTLED IS NOT A PERFORMANCE CHOICE for anything measuring latency:
#     unthrottled, a bounded poll loop expires in wall-microseconds and the
#     measurement reports the emulator's speed rather than the transport's.
